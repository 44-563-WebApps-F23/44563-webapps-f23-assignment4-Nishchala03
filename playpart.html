 <p style ="color:rgb(20,255,32);"><p>[Turning her head a little.]</p> Have you been round the garden, Miss
Wangel?<br></p>


<p><b><h6>HILDA.</h6></b><br>

Yes, I have been taking a look at it.<br></p>


<p><b><h6>MRS. SOLNESS.</h6></b><br>

And found some flowers too, I see.<br></p>


<p><b><h6>HILDA.</h6></b><br>

Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.<br></p>


<p><b><h6>MRS. SOLNESS.</h6></b><br>

Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.<br></p>


<p><b><h6>HILDA.</h6></b><br>

<p style ="color:rgb(20,255,32);">[Closer.]</p> What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,
then?<br></p>

<p><b><h6>MRS. SOLNESS.</h6></b><br>

<p style ="color:rgb(20,255,32);"><p>[With a faint smile.]</p></p> I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays.<br></p>

<p><b><h6>HILDA.</h6></b><br>

Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely
things there?<br></p>


<p><b><h6>MRS. SOLNESS.</h6></b><br>

It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.<br></p>


<p><b><h6>HILDA.</h6></b><br>

Your own garden!<br></p>
