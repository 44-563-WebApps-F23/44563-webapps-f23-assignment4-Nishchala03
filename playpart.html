 <p style ="color:rgb(20,255,32);">[Turning her head a little.]</p> Have you been round the garden, Miss
Wangel?<br>


<b>HILDA.</b><br>

Yes, I have been taking a look at it.<br>


<b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br>

And found some flowers too, I see.<br>


<b>HILDA.</b><br>

Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.<br>


<b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br>

Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.<br>


<b>HILDA.</b><br>

<p style ="color:rgb(20,255,32);"></p>[Closer.] What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,
then?

<b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br>

<p style ="color:rgb(20,255,32);">[With a faint smile.]</p> I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays.

<b>HILDA.</b><br>

Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely
things there?<br>


<b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br>

It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.<br>


<b>HILDA.</b><br>

Your own garden!
