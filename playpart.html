<p>MRS. SOLNESS.

[Turning her head a little.] Have you been round the garden, Miss
Wangel?


HILDA.

Yes, I have been taking a look at it.


MRS. SOLNESS.

And found some flowers too, I see.


HILDA.

Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.


MRS. SOLNESS.

Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.


HILDA.

[Closer.] What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,
then?


MRS. SOLNESS.

[With a faint smile.] I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays.


HILDA.

Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely
things there?


MRS. SOLNESS.

It has all become so strange to me. I am almost afraid to see it again.


HILDA.

Your own garden!

MARY.
It seems different; perhaps it's the night.
OLLIVANT.
I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
mother there so often this spring.
EMILY.
[_Quietly._]
This dry spell is not good for flowers.
OLLIVANT.
It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
hill.
[_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.]
Is there any of that spray
mixture left, Emily, dear?
EMILY.
I haven't looked lately.
